The Indiana Department of Local Government Finance aggregates tax and property data from around the state. Data is submitted in
a unique and very particular text file format, defined in Article 26 of Chapter 50 of the Indiana Administative Code 
(http://www.in.gov/dlgf/files/50_IAC_26_New_File_Formats.pdf).

I needed to access sales disclosure data so I wrote this tool to convert the three sales disclosure file formats to CSV.
Once the data are in CSV format they are much easier to deal with either directly via LibreOffice or by importing to a real
database using csvtools. 

Comments, questions, pull requests, etc welcome.
